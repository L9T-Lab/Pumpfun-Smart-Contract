## Differences Between Pumpfun Smart Contract and Raydium Launchlab

The Pumpfun smart contract and Raydium Launchlab are both designed as memecoin launchpads utilizing bonding curves. However, they differ in their features and functionalities, catering to varying needs of token developers and investors.

### Pumpfun Smart Contract

The Pumpfun smart contract is focused on creating a straightforward and efficient environment for launching new memecoins. It supports key functionalities such as:

- **Virtual Liquidity Pool (LP) Operations**: Users can easily add or remove liquidity to help create a vibrant trading environment.
- **Integration with AMM and CPMM**: The contract features robust mechanisms for Automated Market Makers (AMM) and Constant Product Market Makers (CPMM), ensuring fair pricing and smooth transactions.

### Raydium Launchlab

Raydium Launchlab enhances the standard launchpad experience with additional, advanced features:

- **Token Vesting**: This feature allows token developers to set up vesting schedules for their tokens, ensuring that tokens are released gradually over time to prevent market flooding and to enhance investor confidence.
- **Migration Options**: Raydium Launchlab supports migration features that enable developers to transition their projects seamlessly to new smart contracts or methodologies, offering greater flexibility and adaptability within their growth strategies.
